<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The final purpose is to understand the proof of Read's conjecture stating that the absolute value of coefficients of the chromatic polynomial of a graph is unimodal. Note that June Huh was awarded the Fields Medal in 2022 due to the mentioned work and more work in this direction. The proof is established in a series of papers with main ideas originally from algebraic geometry. The main geometric object is toric varieties, a sort of algebraic variety parametrized by combinatorial objects --- fans.
