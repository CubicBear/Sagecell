<h2>Reading Group — Affine Weyl Groups 2024</h2>

<a href="/doc/affineNotes.pdf">Notes</a>

<p>This seminar will provide an elementary and combinatorial introduction to affine Weyl groups. These groups are a family of infinite groups that exhibit similar properties to finite Weyl groups. The infinite nature of affine Weyl groups adds a layer of complexity and interest to the theory.</p>

<p>Affine Weyl groups are connected to various research topics in combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and representation theory. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Representations of affine Lie algebras</li>
    <li>Quantum cohomology of flag varieties</li>
    <li>Macdonald polynomials</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this seminar is to make papers in these areas more accessible to participants. Attendees should have a basic understanding of finite Weyl groups. We recommend the following references to help you prepare:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Humphreys. Reflection Groups and Coxeter Groups.</li>
    <li>Bjorner, Brenti. Combinatorics of Coxeter Groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will begin with a review of the finite theory in the first lecture. During the seminar, we will refer to the following notes and texts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Humphreys. Reflection Groups and Coxeter Groups.</li>
    <li>Macdonald. Affine Hecke Algebras and Orthogonal Polynomials.</li>
</ul>
